# What is this?

# Why?

# How did you test it works without  regressions?

# If this is a new feature what may a critical error (P0) look like? 

### Things to consider to not repeat mistakes we've learned from many times
- [ ] If P0 errors fire do we ping team in some obvious way (e.g., slack)? 
- [ ] Are there debug logs + a way to see these logs if we need to debug?
- [ ] Is this documented enough a dev could work on this code without getting stuck or having to ping you?
