# Please do this if you're shipping code 
- One git repo per service
    - ft. README saying 
        - What it is
        - How to run it locally for dev
        - How to ship it
- If your service is callable from other services, expose an interface + client to call it 
- Duplicate code in a service should be a function 
- Support 10x scale. If 0 users will run your code, build to support at least 1. If 10, support at least 100, etc
- Test enough to respect the time of users + devs
    - It costs more time/energy to find + debug + fix bugs later 
    - If you're making a major change test it accordingly
